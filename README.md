# OTP Verification System

Created a One Time Password (OTP) verification system which generates a random 6 digit OTP and sends it to the given email address. It then checks if the entered OTP is same as the generated OTP. It also checks if the user entered a valid email address or not. It allows users to resend OTP on the same email address or a different one.
